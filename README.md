# quiz-app


In this repo,I have developed a quiz application consisting of 10 questions using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies. The web application has been deployed on Firebase, allowing users to access it through the following link: https://quiz-app08.web.app. This quiz is designed to test users' knowledge on various topics, offering an interactive and engaging experience. With its user-friendly interface and seamless functionality, the quiz app provides an enjoyable way for participants to challenge themselves and enhance their understanding of different subjects.

Feel free to explore the quiz and share your feedback!
